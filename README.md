A bot to help out around the neighborhood.

## DESCRIPTION

Hey neighbor. I'm glad we're together again. I am here to help you with your neighborhood. I have a certain set of skills to help you.

### LUNCH DATES

Do you have an idea for your community on how to improve it? Do you need help with an aspect of your business or neighborhood? Lunch is a great way to chat with someone else who has the same need. Use me to watch for others in your community who have the same need. When I find a match, I will try and set up a lunch date between you two. I'll help get the ball rolling.
